OBJECT-ORIENTED PROGRAMMING

what is object-oriented programming? It is a method of structuring a program by grouping related properties and behaviors into individual objects.

Python is an object-oriented language: this means that, at its very core, Python stores all information in classes and objects. Except for control flow, everything in Python is an object.

In this lesson, we are taking a peek under the hood. Understanding OOP will help you see the world as a programmer does. It'll help you know your code, not just what's happening line by line, but also the bigger concepts behind it.

important concepts:

classes: a class is a blueprint for creating an object. When you write (or: define) a class, you define the general behavior that a whole category of objects can have; a function that is part of a class is called a method.

objects: an object is an individual representation of a class. When you create individual objects from the class, each object is automatically equipped with the general behavior; you can then give each object whatever unique traits you desire.

An object could represent a dog with properties like a name and age, and behaviors such as sitting or rolling over. An object could also represent an email with properties like a recipient list, subject, and body, and behaviors like adding attachments or sending. Object-oriented programming is an approach for modeling concrete things and the relations between those things. OOP models those things as software objects that have some data associated with them, and can perform certain functions.

instantiation: making an object from a class; we say "to instantiate an object". That object then is called an instance of a class.

"""
# Each instance created from the Dog class will store a name and an age, and
# weâ€™ll give each dog the ability to sit() and roll_over():

class Dog:
    """constructor"""

        # instance attributes

        self.age = age

        # functions accessible only by the class
