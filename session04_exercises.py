Exercises session 04.

Make a program that can read questions from a text file, present these questions to a user and save responses into a csv file.

The program has to:
    1. run until it receives the instructions from the user to stop.
    2. avoid crashing if the question or response file are not found or can't be opened
    3. register and answer and response time for each answer
    4. after the questionnaire is compleat it should print the average score (or calculate a result) for the individual as well as the average for all respondents in the answer file.

"""
# Hint: Start with the SUS_evaluation.py script for inspiration.
# Hint: use try -- execpt conditionals to avoid program crashes in file operations.
# Hint: open question file in read mode and csv file in append mode.
# Hint: for response time look at the time and datetime libraries.
